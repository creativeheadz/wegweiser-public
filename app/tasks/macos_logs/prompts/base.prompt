ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
{criteria}

LOG DATA ANALYSIS:
Analyze the following macOS log categories:
- **Errors**: System errors and faults that indicate problems
- **Security**: Security-related events and potential threats  
- **Crashes**: Application and system crashes indicating instability

SCORING CRITERIA (0-100):
- 90-100: Minimal errors, no security issues, rare crashes
- 80-89: Few minor errors, no security threats, occasional crashes
- 70-79: Some errors present, minor security events, moderate crashes
- 60-69: Regular errors, some security concerns, frequent crashes
- 50-59: Many errors, security issues present, high crash rate
- 30-49: Severe error patterns, security threats, system instability
- 0-29: Critical system issues, major security problems, constant crashes

ANALYSIS FOCUS:
- Identify the most critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Assess security posture and potential vulnerabilities
- Evaluate system stability and performance impact
- Provide actionable recommendations for improvement
