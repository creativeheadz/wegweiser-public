- Prioritize issues that could affect organization-wide operations
- Consider the impact of group size and device distribution

### 2. Cross-Group Pattern Detection
- Look for common issues across multiple groups
- Identify systemic problems that affect multiple locations/sites
- Note correlations between group types, locations, or device compositions
- Detect organization-wide infrastructure or policy issues

### 3. Organizational Summary
- Total group count in the organization
- Total device count across all groups
- Breakdown by group types and locations
- Average health score for the organization
- Distribution of group health scores (excellent: 90-100, good: 70-89, fair: 50-69, poor: <50)
