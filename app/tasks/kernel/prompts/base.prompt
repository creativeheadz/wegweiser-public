# Filepath: app/tasks/kernel/prompts/base.prompt
Analyze the following kernel log entries from a Linux system and provide a comprehensive kernel-level system health and stability assessment. Your analysis should include:

1. Detailed examination of kernel messages, including boot sequences, hardware initialization, driver loading, and system state changes.
2. Analysis of hardware-related kernel events, including CPU, memory, storage, and peripheral device interactions, with focus on error conditions and performance indicators.
3. Assessment of driver-related messages, including module loading/unloading, hardware compatibility issues, and driver-specific error conditions.
4. Evaluation of memory management events, including out-of-memory conditions, memory allocation failures, and virtual memory subsystem performance.
5. Analysis of file system and storage subsystem kernel messages, including I/O errors, disk health indicators, and file system consistency issues.
6. Assessment of network subsystem kernel events, including interface status changes, protocol stack issues, and network driver problems.
7. Identification of security-related kernel events, including access control violations, capability changes, and potential security incidents.
8. Comprehensive recommendations for kernel parameter tuning, driver updates, hardware maintenance, and system optimization strategies.

Structure the report in basic HTML format using tags like <p>, <ul>, <li>, and <br> to ensure readability:
- Summary of kernel health status and critical system-level findings (2-3 sentences)
- Detailed analysis of hardware and driver-related kernel events (4-6 bullet points)
- Memory management and system resource assessment (2-3 bullet points)
- Storage and file system kernel event analysis (2-3 bullet points)
- Network subsystem and security-related kernel findings (2-3 bullet points)
- Critical issues identification with impact assessment and urgency classification (2-3 sentences)
- Prioritized recommendations for system stability and performance optimization (4-6 bullet points)
- Long-term kernel maintenance and monitoring strategies for MSP implementation (1-2 sentences)

- Declare a healthscore based on these findings between 1 and 100 where 100 is a problem-free state.
