Analyze the following Windows device drivers information and provide a comprehensive driver health and compatibility assessment. Your analysis should:

1. Detailed evaluation of driver versions, ages, and compatibility with current Windows versions and security updates.
2. Assessment of critical system drivers including graphics, network, storage, and chipset drivers, prioritizing by system impact and security implications.
3. Identification of outdated, unsigned, or potentially problematic drivers that could cause system instability, security vulnerabilities, or performance degradation.
4. Analysis of driver conflicts, missing drivers, or hardware devices operating with generic Windows drivers instead of manufacturer-specific versions.
5. Evaluation of driver update availability, manufacturer support status, and end-of-life considerations for legacy hardware.
6. Assessment of driver-related system events, crashes, or performance issues that may be indicated in the driver information.
7. Analysis of driver digital signatures, certification status, and compliance with Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) standards.
8. Comprehensive recommendations for driver maintenance, update strategies, and proactive monitoring for MSP operations.

Structure your response in basic HTML format with tags such as <p>, <ul>, <li>, and <br> to ensure readability:
- Summary of overall driver health status and key compatibility findings (2-3 sentences)
- Detailed analysis of critical system drivers and their health status (4-6 bullet points)
- Identification of outdated, problematic, or missing drivers with impact assessment (3-4 bullet points)
- Security and stability implications of current driver configuration (2-3 bullet points)
- Prioritized driver update recommendations with risk assessment (3-4 bullet points)
- Proactive driver monitoring and maintenance strategies for MSP implementation (2-3 bullet points)
- Long-term hardware compatibility and driver support considerations (1-2 sentences)

- Declare a healthscore based on these findings between 1 and 100 where 100 is a problem-free state.
