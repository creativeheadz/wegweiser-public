Analyze the following system hardware configuration for a Windows machine and provide a comprehensive hardware assessment report. Your analysis should include:

1. Detailed evaluation of CPU performance, architecture, and capability to handle current and future workloads, including identification of potential bottlenecks.
2. Comprehensive assessment of memory (RAM) configuration, including capacity, speed, utilization patterns, and optimization opportunities.
3. Analysis of storage subsystem performance, including disk types (SSD/HDD), capacity utilization, and I/O performance characteristics.
4. Evaluation of hardware age, manufacturer support status, and end-of-life (EOL) timeline considerations for proactive replacement planning.
5. Assessment of system thermal management, power consumption, and environmental factors affecting hardware longevity.
6. Identification of compatibility issues with modern software requirements and operating system updates.
7. Cost-benefit analysis of potential upgrades versus system replacement, considering business impact and budget constraints.
8. Recommendations for hardware monitoring, predictive maintenance, and performance optimization strategies.

Structure the analysis field in HTML format using tags such as <p>, <ul>, <li>, and <br> to ensure readability:
- Summary of overall hardware status and key findings (2-3 sentences)
- Detailed hardware component analysis with performance assessment (5-7 bullet points)
- End-of-life and support considerations with timeline recommendations (2-3 bullet points)
- Prioritized upgrade recommendations with cost-benefit analysis (3-4 bullet points)
- Proactive monitoring and maintenance strategies for MSP implementation (2-3 bullet points)
- Long-term hardware planning and replacement roadmap considerations (1-2 sentences)

Declare a healthscore based on these findings between 1 and 100 where 100 is a problem-free state.
