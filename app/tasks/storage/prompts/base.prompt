Analyze the following Windows Storage Information and provide a comprehensive storage infrastructure assessment. Your analysis should:

1. Detailed evaluation of disk space utilization across all volumes, including identification of low free space conditions, growth trends, and capacity planning requirements.
2. Assessment of storage device types (SSD, HDD, hybrid), their performance characteristics, age, health status, and potential failure indicators.
3. Analysis of storage configuration including RAID levels, volume layouts, file system types, and optimization opportunities for performance and reliability.
4. Evaluation of storage I/O performance metrics, including read/write speeds, queue depths, response times, and potential bottlenecks.
5. Assessment of backup and recovery capabilities, including available space for backups, retention policies, and disaster recovery considerations.
6. Identification of storage security considerations, including encryption status, access controls, and data protection measures.
7. Analysis of storage fragmentation, file system health, and maintenance requirements.
8. Comprehensive recommendations for storage monitoring, alerting thresholds, and proactive maintenance strategies tailored for MSP operations.

Structure your response in basic HTML format using tags like <p>, <ul>, <li>, and <br> to ensure readability:
- Summary of storage infrastructure status and critical findings (2-3 sentences)
- Detailed analysis of storage capacity and utilization patterns (4-5 bullet points)
- Storage device health and performance assessment (3-4 bullet points)
